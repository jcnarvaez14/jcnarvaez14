Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I specialize in blending **technical skills** (Python, VBA, SQL, Power BI) with **business insight** to support decision-making, automate reporting, and create tailored tools for analysts and non-technical teams.

With a background in engineering and finance, I've worked on projects involving data quality pipelines, ESG metrics, descriptive statistics, and process automation.
